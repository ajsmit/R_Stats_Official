# Prerequisites

A prerequisite for this course is a basic proficiency in using R [\@R2017]. The necessary experience will have been gained from completing the [Intro R Workshop: Data Manipulation, Analysis, and Graphing](https://ajsmit.github.io/Intro_R_Official/) Workshop that was part of your BCB Core Honours module (i.e. Biostatistics). You will also need a laptop with R and RStudio installed as per the instructions provided in that workshop. If you do not have a personal laptop, most computers in the 5th floor lab will be correctly set up for this purpose.

# Overview of Statistical Methods

You will encounter the following statistics in this module (in the process of being updated):

-   [ `adonis2()` ] Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance Using Distance Matrices

These links point to online resources such as datasets and R scripts in support of the lecture material. It is essential that you work through these examples and workflows.
