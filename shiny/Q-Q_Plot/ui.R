# Define UI for application that helps students interpret the
# pattern of (normal) QQ plots.
# By using this app, we can show students the different patterns
# of QQ plots (and the histograms,
# for completeness) for different type of data distributions.
# For example, left skewed heavy tailed
# data, etc.

# This app can be (and is encouraged to be) used in a reversed
# way, namely, show the QQ plot to the
# students first, then tell them based on the pattern of the QQ
# plot, the data is right skewed, bimodal,
# heavy-tailed, etc.
